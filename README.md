## Run or raise

Script to run any application, or raise up window, if it already running. If you bind this invocation to hotkey, you got next:
- if application is not running, it will be started
- if application is up, but not in focus, window will bring up
- if application have several windows, the each next press will bring focus to next window of this application (cycle thought windows)
- if application have only one window, the second press will minimize it

Sample of usage:
```bash
/home/disfinder/opt/run-or-raise atom atom
```
