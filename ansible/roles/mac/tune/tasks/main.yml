# Commenting the following line from /etc/ssh_config file on my Mac was the solution for me:

#   SendEnv LANG LC_*


# ctrl+arrows in iterm2
# bash

# Just add the following to ~/.inputrc:
#
# "\e[1;5D": backward-word
# "\e[1;5C": forward-word
#
# zsh

# zsh by default does not use the readline library and therefore won't read ~/.inputrc. To get the same functionality, you could add the following to your ~/.zshrc â€“ this again would use the alt key:

# bindkey -e
# bindkey '^[[1;9C' forward-word
# bindkey '^[[1;9D' backward-word
